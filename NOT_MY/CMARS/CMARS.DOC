Hi,
	This is a version of MARS that you can walk through.  You can 
	also rotate your point of view in increments of 15 degrees and
	it will show you the map from the new point of view and you
	can walk along the new point of view.

	Keys are:

	H	move left
	J	move backwards
	K	move forwards
	L	move right
	A	Rotate Left
	S	Rotate Right
	X	quit
	Q	quit


	you will quickly notice that this program gives you a view 
	through a fisheye lens, especially if you walk left or right.
	I leave the distribution that way; the point of view covers
	180 degrees which is why it looks fishy.  I suppose limiting 
	the point of view to less than 180 degrees would help.  I used
	a modified version of the circle routine given in Wilton to
	do calculate the points to display, if anyone is interested
	in the equations e-mail me at gclind01@ulkyvx.louisville.edu
	and I'll type them in for you.

	Files you should have:

	cmars.c, cmars.h   C Driver code
	camars.asm         Video code written in ASM
	sin.c              Sin/Cos table generator
	sintab.asm         Sin/cos tables
	makefile           borland C 4.5 makefile


	I'm indebted to the original author for fractal code and
	generating maps, also parts of the display routines come from
	the original author.  He was anonymous, however...  My
	primary contribution was cleaning up his mess, making the 
	routines callable from C, and enhanced display routines that
	allow for the 3-d rotations.

	This program uses 386 instructions and will not run on an
	8086 or a 286.
